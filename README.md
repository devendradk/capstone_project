## Predictors of Startup Success

### Introduction

A startup refers to a new company, often still in its project phase, that aims to develop innovative solutions capable of transforming industries. While entrepreneurship encompasses all new businesses, including self-employment ventures and those without plans for formal registration, startups specifically focus on scaling and validating an economic model.

Startups play a vital role in driving economic growth. They introduce fresh ideas, propel innovation, create groundbreaking technologies, and serve as key sources of employment. Over the last 20 years, the number of startups has grown exponentially, along with the capital invested in them.

Startups are characterized by high uncertainty and significant risk, with only a fraction achieving success and influence. Their reliance on substantial funding further complicates securing investments. For instance, Venture Capital Funds, the primary investors in startups, have an average success rate of just 1 out of 32 investments leading to an IPO. My personal experience in this field has revealed that investors often lack objective tools to assess the attributes that contribute to a startup’s success.

Before diving deeper, it is crucial to define “startup success.” While stories of "unicorns" like Facebook or Amazon often come to mind, startup success is generally considered the achievement of an "Exit." An Exit can take the form of an acquisition (M&A) or an IPO (Initial Public Offering).

### Project Overview

The emergence and evolution of startups have accelerated in recent years, yet most fail—a startling 9 out of 10. What distinguishes successful startups? Factors such as team and founder experience, funding, location, product, and market conditions may all play a role. Why are some startups acquired early while others are not? Are there specific elements that attract larger companies to acquire certain startups? This report explores these questions using the Startup Success Prediction dataset available on Kaggle.

### Problem Statement

The startup ecosystem requires individuals to make critical decisions, especially concerning funding rounds or acquisitions leading to ownership changes. Decision-makers need access to comprehensive insights based on the vast datasets available today, covering aspects like company performance, funding rounds, and acquisitions.

This project aims to develop supervised learning models capable of predicting startup success. These models also enhance understanding of the variables most impactful to the acquisition or failure of a startup. Multiple supervised algorithms will be evaluated to compare results and identify key influential factors.

### Performance Metrics

To measure the effectiveness of each model, metrics such as the True Positive Rate, False Positive Rate, and the Area Under the ROC Curve (AUC_ROC) will be used. These rates are derived from the classifiers’ confusion matrix, and since the dataset is expected to be imbalanced, these metrics are more valuable than accuracy.

Given the smaller number of acquisitions compared to operational or closed startups, accuracy alone might present misleadingly high scores without effectively identifying companies likely to be acquired. The ROC curve, which combines TPR (y-axis) and FPR (x-axis), provides a comprehensive metric for binary classification problems.

### Summary of Results

While all models exhibited similar ROC_AUC scores, the AdaBoost model achieved the highest score of 0.810, whereas Logistic Regression recorded the lowest at 0.796.

Insights from Decision Tree-Based Classifiers

AdaBoost and Random Forest models rely on regression trees. These models tend to assign lower importance to One-Hot Encoded variables since decision trees weigh variables based on subsets of the data.

In these models, the "has_VC" feature emerged as the most critical predictor.

The "relationships" variable demonstrated consistent predictive importance across classifiers.

Surprisingly, total funding in USD was not significantly influential on a company's success, challenging the assumption that high fundraising equates to higher chances of success.

### Insights from Other Models

Logistic Regression and SVM identified "relationships" and "is_top500" as the two most important features.

Sectors like "ecommerce" and "biotech" showed higher success rates.

The presence of a VC funding round strongly correlated with success, whereas subsequent rounds had diminishing importance, with Round D being the most crucial later stage.

Interestingly, California—a prominent state for startups—was not as significant a predictor of success as anticipated.

### Conclusion

### Key predictors of startup success include:

Relationships: A broader strategic network enhances the likelihood of success.

has_VC: Early-stage institutional investors with extensive networks and industry expertise significantly impact success.

has_round_D: Companies reaching this stage have demonstrated sustained growth and profitability, making them less risky investments.

is_biotech and is_ecommerce: These industries have gained substantial attention and interest from investors, reflecting their importance in predictive models.

### Business Interpretation

Relationships: While the nature of these relationships remains unclear (clients or investors), the strategic network size plays a vital role in success.

has_VC: The presence of initial institutional investors marks a critical milestone for startups.

has_round_D: Indicates continued success and sustained growth, showcasing low-risk investment opportunities.

is_biotech and is_ecommerce: These sectors represent promising opportunities with investor excitement over the last decade.

### Next Steps & Improvements

Improve dataset quality: The current dataset appears heavily manipulated and lacks detailed variable descriptions. Accessing raw data with clear annotations would enhance analysis.

Broaden dataset scope: Sampling a more diverse startup market could yield different insights, although the current findings remain reasonable.

Combine financial and dynamic data: Integrating financial data with company-related news through natural language processing has shown promising results, raising TPR from 60% to 79.8%.

Explore additional data sources: VC investment questionnaires could provide further insights into predictors of startup success.

Enhance feature engineering: Refining the dataset features may uncover stronger correlations and insights.
